# DLRA
A straightforward implementation of the *Dynamical Low Rank Approximation* (DLRA) for SDE.

This is quite straightforward, just run ``generate_dlra_traj(x0, n, N, Ïƒ, b, h, r)`` where 

- ``x0``is the initial datum, that is a matrix of size $d \times N$
- ``n`` is the number of steps of the numerical scheme
- ``N`` is the number of particles (or, through propagation of chaos, the number of trajectories)
- ``$\sigma$`` is the diffusion matrix, a function that maps $d$-dimensional vector onto matrices of size $d \times m$
- ``b`` is the drift vector, hence a function that maps $d$-dimensional vectors onto themselves
- ``h`` is the timestep
- ``r`` is the targeted rank in the DLRA
